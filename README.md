<h1 align="center">sugarscape</h1>

Python implementation of Epstein and Axtell's large scale agent-based computational model, the Sugarscape, to explore the role of social phenomenon such as seasonal migrations, pollution, sexual reproduction, combat, and transmission of disease and even culture.  
In other words: Cellular Automata + Agents = Sugarscape.

More info is available in the project wiki.
